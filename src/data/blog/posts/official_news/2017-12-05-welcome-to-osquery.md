Welcome to the new [osquery.io](https://osquery.io) homepage. This is build
using React and features a new news, community, and inline documentation set of
pages.

You'll find this post in the `/src/data/blog/` directory. Go ahead and edit it
and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many
different ways, but the most common is to run: `bundle exec jekyll serve` which
launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `/src/data/blog/` directory that
follows the convention `YYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` and includes the necessary
front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how
it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end

print_hi('osquery users')
#=> prints 'Hi, osquery users' to STDOUT
```

Check out the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) for more info on
how to get the most out of Jekyll. Fil all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll's
GitHub repo](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll). If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/).
