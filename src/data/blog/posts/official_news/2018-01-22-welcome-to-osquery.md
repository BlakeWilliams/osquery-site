Welcome to the new [osquery.io](https://osquery.io) blog. This blog is built using React and features a new news, community, and inline documentation set of pages. This website is open source and you can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/osquery/osquery-site).

You'll find this post in the [`/src/data/blog/posts/`](https://github.com/osquery/osquery-site/tree/master/src/data/blog/posts) directory of the website repository. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common is to run: `yarn install && yarn start` which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated. See the [README](https://github.com/osquery/osquery-site/blob/master/README.md) for more information on contributing to the content of this website.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the [`/src/data/blog/posts/`](https://github.com/osquery/osquery-site/tree/master/src/data/blog/posts) directory that follows the convention `YYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
